# SpeechDemo

A minimal SwiftUI macOS app demonstrating the Qwen3 Speech library: mic recording with ASR transcription and text-to-speech synthesis with playback.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+ (Sequoia)
- Apple Silicon (M1 or later)
- Xcode 16+

## Build & Run

1. Open `Examples/SpeechDemo/` in Xcode (File > Open, select this folder)
2. Xcode resolves the SPM dependency on the parent `Qwen3Speech` package automatically
3. Select the `SpeechDemo` scheme and press Run

### Entitlements (Xcode project only)

If running from an Xcode project, add these entitlements to the signing config:

- `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` — required for App Sandbox
- `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` — microphone access for recording
- `com.apple.security.network.client` — outbound network for model downloads

The entitlements file is provided at `SpeechDemo/SpeechDemo.entitlements`.

### Command-line build

```bash
cd Examples/SpeechDemo
swift build
```

Note: The command-line build produces an executable, not a sandboxed .app bundle. Microphone access requires running from Xcode with proper entitlements, or granting Terminal microphone permission in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone.

## Usage

The app has three tabs:

### Dictate

1. Select an ASR engine: **Parakeet TDT** (CoreML, ~400 MB) or **Qwen3-ASR** (MLX, ~400 MB)
2. Click **Load** to download the model (first run only — cached in `~/Library/Caches/qwen3-speech/`)
3. Hold the **Record** button, speak, then release
4. The transcription appears below — click **Copy** to copy to clipboard

### Speak

1. Click **Load Qwen3-TTS** to download the model (~1 GB, first run only)
2. Type or paste text into the text field
3. Select a language from the dropdown
4. Click **Synthesize** — audio plays automatically when ready

### Echo (Voice Pipeline)

1. Click **Load Models** — downloads Silero VAD (CoreML), Parakeet TDT (CoreML), and Qwen3-TTS (MLX)
2. Click **Start** to begin the voice pipeline
3. Speak into the mic — the pipeline detects speech, transcribes it, and speaks it back
4. Full-duplex: you can interrupt the agent while it's speaking (barge-in)
5. Click **Stop** to end the session

The Echo tab uses the `SpeechCore` voice pipeline with AEC (acoustic echo cancellation) for full-duplex operation.
