# Streaming Audio Playback

## Architecture

`StreamingAudioPlayer` uses an event-driven architecture based on `AVAudioSourceNode`. Instead of scheduling buffers to a player node (push model), the audio hardware **pulls** data from a ring buffer via a render callback when it needs it.

```
TTS (producer thread)          Hardware (render thread)
        │                              │
        │  scheduleChunk([Float])      │
        ├─────────► Ring Buffer ◄──────┤  render callback
        │           (SPSC)             │  reads samples
        │                              │
        │  markGenerationComplete()    │  detects empty + done
        │                              │  → onPlaybackFinished
```

This is the standard approach in professional audio: the producer writes samples into a buffer, and the consumer (hardware) reads when ready. The buffer decouples the two — the producer doesn't need to match the hardware's timing.

## The Buffer Underflow Problem

TTS generates audio in chunks. Each chunk takes variable time to compute. If we feed chunks directly to the audio output, any gap between chunks causes silence and pops — **buffer underflow**.

```
Without pre-buffer:
  TTS:    [chunk1]---wait 870ms---[chunk2]---wait---[chunk3]
  Player: [play][silence/pop][play][silence/pop][play]
```

In audio, you cannot assume the processing pipeline will deliver data fast enough to keep the output fed. The output cannot wait — it runs at a fixed sample rate driven by hardware clocks.

## Pre-Buffer Solution

The solution is universal across all audio systems: introduce a buffer between the producer and consumer, and start playback only after the buffer has accumulated enough data.

```
With pre-buffer (2s):
  TTS:    [chunk1][chunk2][chunk3][chunk4]...
               ↓
  Ring Buffer: [accumulate 2s of audio]
               ↓ start playback when buffer is full
  Hardware:    [continuous audio pull, no gaps]
```

Once playback starts:
- The buffer drains at real-time rate (1s of audio per second)
- TTS fills it faster than real-time (RTF < 1.0 means it generates faster than playback)
- The buffer level only grows — underflow is impossible

If TTS temporarily stalls (CPU spike, GC pause), the buffer absorbs the jitter. This is why buffer size matters — it's the maximum stall duration you can tolerate without audible artifacts.

## Buffer Size: The Key Tradeoff

Buffer size is a latency vs quality tradeoff:

- **Larger buffer** = more resilient to jitter, but higher first-audio latency
- **Smaller buffer** = lower latency, but risk of underflow if generation hiccups

| `preBufferDuration` | First-audio latency | Risk | Use case |
|---------------------|--------------------:|------|----------|
| 0 | ~130ms | High (any gap = underflow) | Single-pass TTS (Kokoro) where all audio arrives at once |
| 0.5 | ~0.6s | Medium | Low-latency voice assistant, fast hardware |
| 1.0 | ~1.1s | Low | Streaming TTS (default, recommended for Qwen3-TTS) |
| 2.0 | ~2.1s | Very low | Slow hardware, high system load |
| 3.0 | ~3.1s | Minimal | High jitter, Bluetooth audio, slow hardware |

### Factors that affect optimal buffer size

1. **Generation speed (RTF)** — if RTF is 0.5 (2x real-time), a 2s buffer gives 2s of headroom before underflow. If RTF is 0.9, you need a larger buffer.

2. **Hardware output buffer** — the audio device has its own buffer (typically 256-1024 frames at 48kHz = 5-21ms). Your pre-buffer should be significantly larger than this.

3. **System load** — CPU/GPU contention can cause generation spikes. Under load, RTF can temporarily exceed 1.0. The pre-buffer absorbs these spikes.

4. **Audio route** — Bluetooth adds 40-200ms of output latency. The pre-buffer should account for this to avoid the output running dry during route switching.

In professional audio applications, buffer size is often exposed as a user setting — the user adjusts until they find the sweet spot between latency and stability for their specific hardware.

## How It Works: Event-Driven Model

The audio hardware drives playback via an event-driven callback (Apple's `AVAudioSourceNode`):

1. Audio hardware needs N frames of audio
2. It calls our render callback
3. We read N samples from the ring buffer
4. If the buffer is empty and generation isn't done → output silence (underflow)
5. If the buffer is empty and generation is done → fire `onPlaybackFinished`

This is Apple's implementation of the standard audio callback model. The render callback runs on a real-time priority thread managed by CoreAudio — it must return immediately and never block. The ring buffer enables this: reads are O(1) with no allocation or locking.

## Ring Buffer

`AudioSampleRingBuffer` is a single-producer single-consumer (SPSC) circular buffer:

- **Producer** (TTS thread): calls `write([Float])` — advances write pointer
- **Consumer** (render thread): calls `read(into:count:)` — advances read pointer
- **Capacity**: configurable, default 30s of audio at the engine's sample rate
- **Wrap-around**: both pointers wrap when they reach the end
- **Lock-free for SPSC**: safe for one writer + one reader without locks

## Usage

### Streaming TTS (Qwen3-TTS, CosyVoice)

```swift
let player = StreamingAudioPlayer()
player.preBufferDuration = 2.0  // 2s pre-buffer
try player.start(sampleRate: 24000)

// TTS generates chunks asynchronously
for try await chunk in ttsStream {
    try player.play(samples: chunk.samples, sampleRate: 24000)
}

// Signal end of stream — render callback will drain buffer then fire callback
player.markGenerationComplete()

player.onPlaybackFinished = {
    print("All audio played through speaker")
}
```

### Single-Pass TTS (Kokoro)

```swift
let player = StreamingAudioPlayer()
player.preBufferDuration = 0  // All audio arrives at once
try player.start(sampleRate: 24000)
try player.play(samples: allSamples, sampleRate: 24000)
player.markGenerationComplete()
```

### Voice Pipeline (shared engine with mic)

```swift
let engine = AVAudioEngine()
let player = StreamingAudioPlayer()
player.preBufferDuration = 2.0
player.attach(to: engine, format: playerFormat)

// engine also has mic input tap for VAD/ASR
try engine.start()
```

### Interrupting Playback

```swift
// User speaks over TTS — stop immediately
player.fadeOutAndStop()

// Start new generation
player.resetGeneration()
player.scheduleChunk(newAudioSamples)
player.markGenerationComplete()
```

## End-of-Stream Detection

When `markGenerationComplete()` is called, the render callback knows no more data is coming. Once it reads the last samples from the ring buffer and the buffer is empty, it fires `onPlaybackFinished` on the main thread. No sentinel buffers or grace periods needed — the render callback runs at hardware timing, so completion is detected at the exact moment the last sample is consumed.

For short utterances that don't fill the pre-buffer, `markGenerationComplete()` forces playback to start from whatever has accumulated.

## Generation Timing Reference (M2 Max)

| TTS Engine | RTF | Chunk size | Chunk interval | Recommended pre-buffer |
|------------|-----|-----------|----------------|----------------------:|
| Qwen3-TTS 0.6B (4-bit) | 0.53 | 2.0s | ~1.07s | 2.0s |
| Qwen3-TTS 1.7B (8-bit) | 0.79 | 2.0s | ~1.58s | 3.0s |
| CosyVoice3 (4-bit) | 0.59 | ~150ms | ~100ms | 1.0s |
| Kokoro-82M (CoreML) | N/A | all at once | ~45ms | 0s |

RTF = Real-Time Factor (time to generate / audio duration). RTF < 1.0 means generation is faster than playback.

## Apple Audio Architecture

### AVAudioEngine Graph Topology

`AVAudioEngine` manages a processing graph of audio nodes connected by buses:

```
Input Node (mic) ──► Main Mixer Node ──► Output Node (speaker)
                          ▲
Player/Source Nodes ───────┘
```

The input node captures microphone audio. Player and source nodes inject synthesized audio. The main mixer node mixes all sources and routes the result to the output node (speaker hardware). Each connection has a format (sample rate, channel count, interleaved/non-interleaved).

### Voice Processing (AEC)

Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) prevents the microphone from picking up audio that the speaker is playing. Apple implements this via Voice Processing I/O:

```swift
try engine.inputNode.setVoiceProcessingEnabled(true)
```

Critical ordering: `setVoiceProcessingEnabled(true)` must be called on the input node **before** reading its format. Enabling Voice Processing changes the input node's format — the channel count often jumps to 9 channels (Apple's internal processing format). The echo-cancelled mono signal is on channel 0; the remaining channels carry internal VP metadata.

If you read the format before enabling VP, you get the raw hardware format. After enabling VP, the format changes, and any previously configured taps or connections using the old format will break.

### AVAudioPlayerNode vs AVAudioSourceNode

Apple provides two ways to inject audio into the engine graph:

**AVAudioPlayerNode** schedules buffers for playback. The engine knows exactly what audio will be played because the buffers are submitted ahead of time. This means Voice Processing can predict the speaker output and subtract it from the microphone signal — AEC works correctly.

```swift
let playerNode = AVAudioPlayerNode()
engine.attach(playerNode)
engine.connect(playerNode, to: engine.mainMixerNode, format: monoFormat)
playerNode.scheduleBuffer(buffer, completionHandler: nil)
playerNode.play()
```

**AVAudioSourceNode** uses a render callback — a function called by the audio hardware thread to pull samples on demand. Voice Processing cannot see the render callback's output ahead of time, so it cannot predict what the speaker will play. AEC fails: the microphone picks up the speaker audio as if it were a real voice.

```swift
let sourceNode = AVAudioSourceNode { _, _, frameCount, bufferList -> OSStatus in
    // fill bufferList from ring buffer
    return noErr
}
engine.attach(sourceNode)
engine.connect(sourceNode, to: engine.mainMixerNode, format: monoFormat)
```

### The Fundamental Tradeoff

| | AVAudioPlayerNode | AVAudioSourceNode |
|---|---|---|
| AEC compatible | Yes — VP can predict and cancel its output | No — VP can't see render callback output |
| Streaming gaps | Risk of underflow between scheduled buffers | Zero underflow — callback always returns audio (silence if empty) |
| Use case | Full-duplex (mic + speaker simultaneously) | Standalone playback (no mic needed) |

PlayerNode is gap-prone for streaming TTS because each buffer must be scheduled before the previous one finishes. If there is any delay between `scheduleBuffer` calls — even a few milliseconds — the node stops and must be restarted, causing a click. SourceNode avoids this entirely because the render callback always executes and always fills the buffer (with silence if no audio is available).

### Our Solution

- **Speak tab (standalone TTS playback)**: Uses `AVAudioSourceNode` with the ring buffer architecture described above. No microphone is active, so AEC is irrelevant. The render callback guarantees gap-free audio even when TTS chunk timing is uneven.

- **Echo tab (full-duplex voice pipeline)**: Uses `AVAudioPlayerNode` because AEC is essential — without it, the microphone picks up TTS output and feeds it back into the pipeline as a new utterance, creating an infinite echo loop. The pre-buffer strategy mitigates the gap risk by accumulating enough audio before playback starts.

### Resampling

Most TTS models generate audio at 24kHz (Qwen3-TTS, CosyVoice, Kokoro). VoxCPM2 generates audio at 48kHz directly. The audio engine typically runs at 48kHz (macOS default hardware sample rate). An `AVAudioConverter` handles on-the-fly upsampling from 24kHz to 48kHz when writing into the ring buffer:

```swift
let converter = AVAudioConverter(from: ttsFormat, to: engineFormat)  // 24kHz → 48kHz
converter.convert(to: outputBuffer, from: inputBuffer)
```

The converter uses Apple's built-in sample rate conversion (high-quality sinc interpolation). The ring buffer stores audio at the engine's native rate (48kHz), so the render callback can copy directly without further conversion.

### Format Negotiation

The player node is configured with a mono format matching the TTS output channel count:

```swift
let monoFormat = AVAudioFormat(standardFormatWithSampleRate: 48000, channels: 1)
engine.connect(playerNode, to: engine.mainMixerNode, format: monoFormat)
```

The engine's main mixer node automatically upmixes mono to stereo (or whatever the output hardware expects). This happens transparently — no manual channel mapping is needed. The mixer applies equal-power panning, placing the mono signal equally in both left and right channels.
